# Labs

Start with small, repeatable exercises. Each lab should have:
- goal
- steps
- common issues
- what to write in your README

## Lab 1 — Budget & cost guardrails
- create a budget
- create alerts
- document “how I avoid surprise costs”

## Lab 2 — Network basics
- virtual network
- subnets
- NSG rules
- connectivity checklist
